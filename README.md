# Data Structures in C

This repository contains my hands-on implementation of core data structures in C. Each data structure is implemented from scratch with relevant operations, focusing on both understanding and efficiency.

---

## 📘 Overview

The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in data structures by implementing them manually without relying on built-in libraries. These codes are part of my learning and practice during coursework and personal study for my college.

## 🗂️ Topics Covered

### 🔹 Arrays
- Static and dynamic arrays
- Basic operations: insertion, deletion, searching
- Sorting and searching algorithms (linear, binary)

### 🔹 Linked Lists
- Singly linked list
- Doubly linked list
- Circular linked list
- Operations: insert, delete, reverse, search, rotate, concatenate

### 🔹 Stacks
- Stack using arrays
- Stack using linked list
- Applications: infix to postfix, infix to prefix, vice versa and Tower Of Hanoi

### 🔹 Queues
- Queue using arrays
- Queue using linked list
- Circular queue

### 🔹 Trees
- Binary tree
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder)
- Operations: insert, delete, search, height, mirror, cardinality, sorting

### 🔹 Graphs
- Adjacency matrix and adjacency list representation
- DFS and BFS traversal using Stack & Queue respectively

### 🔹 Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
